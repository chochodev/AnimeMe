This a web app for anime lovers. This includes all functionalities of a normal reviewing website and chat system, ranking system, content creation system and more.



## Tools
- Next13:
  - To handle SEO efficiently.
  - For easy management and updating.
- Chakra UI:
  - For easy and efficient styling.
- Django REST API:
  - My default backend framework which I'm most proficient in.

## Set Up
- After pulling or cloning;
- Run:
  ```npm install ``` or
  ```yarn install ```
- After installing dependacies and packages; run the app locally with:
  ```npm run dev``` or
  ```yarn run dev```

## Needs improvement on optimization 
- Suspending for now;
  - Chakra UI boiler plate load time
- Any suggestions?
- Did a little research recently on ui libraries and stumbled upon mantime, I will be trying it out in place of chakra ui.
I hope it works fine.
